NeoKaraoke is a karaoke video playback queue management application designed to provide a simple and intuitive experience on both Windows and Linux environments. Built with a modern, dark-themed graphical interface, the program allows users to organize and play karaoke songs in MP4 format, leveraging VLC Media Player as an external playback engine.

- **VLC Playback**: Start and stop video playback directly from the app, utilizing VLC's robustness.
- **Rating System**: Evaluate performances with a notes menu (1 to 5 stars), playing corresponding videos (1.mp4 to 5.mp4) from a user-configurable folder.
- **Multilingual Support**: Supports multiple languages (Portuguese, English, Spanish, and French)
- **Search and Filters**: Quickly search songs in the list with an integrated search field.
- **Customizable Interface**: Dark style with DejaVu Sans font, ensuring readability and compatibility across different operating systems.

**Supported Platforms:**
- Windows (with VLC at `C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe`).
- Linux (with VLC at `/usr/bin/vlc`, adjustable based on the distribution). (Testing)

**Usage:**
Perfect for karaoke events, parties, or personal use, NeoKaraoke is portable and requires no complex installation, provided VLC is present on the system.
